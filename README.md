# GUI
Comprehensive GUI spanning training and deployment pipelines

Each push to main SHOULD create a new release called "Automated Build #{release number}"
The app should be downloadable from there and runnable.

Except for pushes that don't modify actual project files.

## HOW TO USE

1. Visit the releases (should be to the right if on desktop ->)
2. Download the release for your system
3. If on Mac, move the application to your applications folder. If on windows, any folder should work (yet to be tested)
4. Run it like a normal application! Auto-Updating should be configured but has yet to be tested.
